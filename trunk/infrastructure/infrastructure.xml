                              <para>Whenever people think of a computer lab, it is usually the computers that they think of first. They do not think
                                        of the room itself, or the construction of the chairs, the desks, the electrical cabling, and the security
                                        measures that need to be in place for the computer lab to work properly. A &productname; cannot just go
                                        anywhere. It requires a specific place with specific things in place in order to function.</para>
                              <para>The <emphasis>where</emphasis> and <emphasis>in what</emphasis> questions need to be asked when planning a
                                        &productname;. The infrastructure surrounding the &productname; is just as important as the computer
                                        hardware and software used. In this part of the &productname; Cookbook we provide an overview of the
                                        environment that the &productname; needs to operate in; the type of room, the security features, the
                                        cabling requirements, and the little details of what and where that make a computer lab function.</para>

                              <para>The situation in South Africa may differ from other parts of the world, but these basic guidelines have arisen out
                                        of our needs and conditions. If you are building a &productname; outside of South Africa you may need to
                                        use other security measures or methods of construction that allow your &productname; to be usable and
                                        safe.</para>

                                        <para>The windows of the &productname; need to be secured so that no one can break into the lab and steal
                                                  the computers, printers, or other lab items. These are the typical requirements for securing the
