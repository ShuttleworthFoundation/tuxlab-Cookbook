                              <para>Our strategy is to leverage and support the intense volunteer spirit that surrounds open source software (OSS) at
                                        present. We aim to stimulate and nurture the creation of a well managed and well coordinated team of OSS
                                        volunteers by providing minimalist but highly specific support, infrastructure, resources and encouragement.
                                        Our funding will be minimal but targeted at energising the group, helping it to coordinate itself, meet
                                        regularly, develop it’s skills, identify interventions, attract new members and spread to other areas.</para>
                              <para>We will create a training program consisting of a series of modules like cabling, network installation, system
                                        administration, computer literacy and business use of computers, as the primary means of attracting
                                        volunteers.</para>
                              <para>This document brings the skills development aspect of our mandate into focus and defines the role that we will
                                        play in increasing open source skills and volunteerism. It also focuses on how we plan to apply the open
                                        source software development model, that relies on volunteers, to our &productname; community

                              <para>The Shuttleworth Foundation (the Foundation) is committed to the improvement of education, with a specific focus
                                        on mathematics, science and technology, as well as the promotion of open source software in South Africa. As a
                                        propagator of `social innovation', the main objective of the Shuttleworth Foundation is to invest in projects
                                        that provide innovative solutions to educational challenges in order to unlock the creative and intellectual
                                        potential of the South African youth, allowing them to live the dream that 'anything is possible'.</para>
                              <para>To further the uptake of technology in South Africa, the Shuttleworth Foundation supports the use of open source
                                        software. The term `open source' refers to computer software that has been built by a global community of
                                        volunteers who make the source code freely available, as opposed to the more widely known style of proprietary
                                        development by a single company. This software is usually available on-line at no cost to the user. The
                                        Shuttleworth Foundation strongly believes that open source software should be the preferred choice of software
                                        for schooling in South Africa.</para>
                              <para>Open source software provides users with freedoms not obtainable from proprietary software, this includes the
                                        freedom to obtain, use, modify and distribute the software. The Shuttleworth Foundation believes that the use
                                        of open source software will provide effective and economical access to information and communication
                                        technology. The Foundation thus aims to initiate, facilitate, support and fund initiatives that will:</para>

                              <para>One of the major challenges that the Foundation faces is creating awareness of the functionality, flexibility and
                                        accessibility of open source. Up to now it would appear that an awareness of open source has been limited to
                                        sophisticated technology users. The Foundation aims to bring open source to learners from all levels of
                                        society – not only to make them aware of its existence, but also how this revolutionary, boundless technology
                                        can be used in software development and training.</para>

                              <para> With this in mind, the Shuttleworth &productname; program was initiated which aims to establish eighty (80)
                                        open source based computer labs in schools in the Western Cape. The primary objective of the &productname;
                                        project is to make the school community aware of open source software and at the same time create an
                                        innovative replicable model for a cost-effective computing platform. Effort is also directed at making this
                                        project sustainable and the primary means of achieving this is through skills transfer and development with
                                        teachers, learners and volunteers. This process empowers staff members and thus builds capacity within the
                                        schools so that maintenance or expansion is controlled by them.</para>
                              <para> Given all of the above, the volunteer support strategy was developed and aims to provide a support structure to
                                        volunteer resources. The volunteer program will run concurrently with the &productname; project, in a
                                        complementary fashion. The main aim is to empower the volunteer group by developing open source skills amongst
                                        them, so that they may run this project one day and play an active role in the local open source community.</para>
                              <para>The volunteer support strategy aims to solve the following problems:</para>

                                        <para>Many computer users are unaware of all the choices they have available to them when it comes to choosing
                                                  software for their needs. By exposing people to open source software we expose them to the choice
                                                  and generate awareness.</para>

                                        <para>Users are generally advocates. If we break down the barrier of entry, we will increase the usage of the
                                                  software and and also the amount of advocates for it. The barrier of entry is the presumption many
                                                  people have about open source, often citing the argument that it is only suited for the more
                                                  technically able users. That is not the case.</para>

                                        <para>Skills development also goes a long way to break down barriers of entry. If volunteers get the
                                                  opportunity to try the software at no risk to their own computers and data, they would be far more
                                                  at ease and could concentrate on learning how to use the software. The &productname; project
                                                  also plays a major role in skill development, volunteers will learn many skills when they
                                                  participate in the implementation of a &productname;, such as network cabling and Linux

                              <para>We want to educate people on GNU/Linux, pass on open source skills and provide a loose-nit support structure to
                                        &productname; schools. By utilising volunteers to help facilitate the process of installing
                                        &productname;s, we will provide an unequalled method of continuing education for skilled and unskilled
                                        volunteers alike. The potential to reach communities and build one at the same time is the underlying idea
                                        behind both the &productname; and volunteer support strategies.</para>

                              <para>Establishing &productname;s is similar in many respects to an open source software project – rather than
                                        develop software, the Foundation is installing labs, but still using the concept of open source volunteerism
                                        to facilitate this process. The Foundation fulfils the role of 'Gatekeeper', acting as a facilitator and
                                        guardian, but using volunteer resources to complete the task.</para>

                              <para>By not generating and feeding skilled volunteers through the &productname; program, the project would start to
                                        rely heavily on the our continued hands-on involvement. This would mean that the program would be limited to
                                        Cape Town schools and potentially not go beyond the borders of the Western Cape. We can not make a success of
                                        the &productname; program, or reach the goal of 80 schools in 2004/5, without the involvement of
                                        volunteers.</para>
                              <para>The &productname; program will be the springboard for this volunteer support strategy. A program like this has
                                        the potential to outlive the Foundation’s strategies and focus, therefore it is crucial that we build capacity
                                        amonst the volunteers, pass on the torch and have it managed so that it can give the volunteer group longevity
                                        and purpose beyond the Shuttleworth &productname; project.</para>

                              <para>As a minimum, 8 volunteers working in two teams of 4, can install 2 &productname;s in one day. If there are
                                        more than 10 participants at one &productname;, generally you will find that most stand around without
                                        anything to do. In an effort to address this, we appoint a project leader for the installation and 2 generals
                                        under him/her. They are tasked with ensuring that everyone participates.</para>

                                        <para>It takes 5 (five) volunteers one day, from 09:00 to 16:00, to install a &productname; from the
                                                  ground up - cabling, thin-client preparation, server installation and troubleshooting. Although
                                                  there are usually more than 5 volunteers at a &productname; installation, 5 is all it will take
                                                  to install one lab.</para>
                                        <para>However, the installation model is continuously evolving, teams of 4 volunteers go out to a school on a
                                                  Thursday, to do the cabling. This makes the Saturday event less work orientated, and streamlines the
                                                  installations. Schools that have had cabling done on a Thursday, generally have their
                                                  &productname; installed before lunch on Saturday. Focus is now directed at educating the staff
                                                  about open source software and giving them ideas on how to integrate their classroom activities into
                                                  the &productname;.</para>

                                                  <para>Volunteers will not be expected to move on from the project, unless they contravene the code

                                                            current volunteers consider the &productname; project to be a hobby, and thus really
                                                            enjoy participating in the weekly activities. A distinction must also be made between
                                                            regular volunteers and community builders. We are fortunate to have both in our group.
                                                            Community builders are there for the eventual goal of bettering education through open
                                                            source software, and don't expect incentives. We consider these people to be partners in

                                                            scarce and will have to be managed efficiently. The first quarter of 2004 will be the
                                                            ramp-up period for the training strategy, so fewer courses will be run. If demand requires
                                                            then the tempo will be upped for the second quarter. Trainers, like volunteers, will not

                                                  “Volunteers on patrol”. If the problem can’t be handled over the phone then the person on duty at
                                                  the LCB will refer the call to a nearby “Reservist” (See: 15.1.3 Module 3 - “Reservists”) who will
                                                  then , hopefully, visit the school and fix the problem.</para>

                                        <para>Once a volunteer has gone through all the training on offer and still participates, will be in a
                                                  position to support a &productname; from the ground up. If the volunteer still wishes to
                                                  participate in the program, then they will be given a list of &productname; schools in their
                                                  area that could do with some support. He/she will then be expected to offer expertise to keep that
                                                  school’s &productname; running smoothly. These “Volunteers on patrol” would be a source of help
                                                  for the school’s computer facilitator. If the schools in the area do not have facilitators, then
                                                  these individuals could be regarded as independent, mobile facilitators.</para>

                                        <para>Facilitators, if the schools can afford them, will be the first line of support for the
                                                  &productname;. A facilitator makes sure that the lab remains operational and that any problems
                                                  with hardware or software is resolved as soon as possible. Currently a facilitator is placed at each
                                                  &productname; school. The volunteer group provides a source for future facilitators.</para>
                                        <para>An ideal situation would be for one facilitator to control a cluster of &productname;s schools.
                                                  Existing clusters are going to adopt this approach after the first year of operation.</para>

                                        <para>The School Linux Users Group (SLUG) was established as an additional vehicle for volunteer
                                                  participation. It provides a forum for volunteers to share knowledge and plan activities while
                                                  collectively forging a unique identity for themselves as they go. The Shuttleworth Foundation is
                                                  steering the group in it's early stages, until members take the initiative and run with it.</para>
                                        <para>The Foundation is also providing web hosting services for the organisation. Mailing lists have been
                                                  set-up for members to communicate, ask questions and announce events. The next step for SLUG is to
                                                  formalise itself by electing a committee, forming a constitution and deciding it's future.</para>
                                        <para> Slug provides a natural mechanism for sourcing training participants as well as managing the practical
                                                  component of the training. SLUG has been the primary vehicle for attracting volunteers with the
                                                  training component as an added benefit of participating in SLUG. The training program requires
                                                  practical experience in the &productname; programme, of which SLUG is a major partner.</para>

                              <para>Due to current employment regulations in South Africa, the two legal documents (Appendix C and D) serve to protect
                                        both the volunteer and the Shuttleworth Foundation, from any confusion regarding the legal status of volunteer
                                        versus employee.</para>
                              <para>The Linux Computer Bank (LCB) is a facility that provides a central support hub for a &productname; cluster.
                                        &productname; volunteers would assist the Foundation in the refurbishment of old computers at the LCB
                                        facility. As the &productname; project moves on and SLUG continues to be the driving force behind the
                                        supply of volunteers, so the distinction between the LCB volunteers and the SLUG volunteers blurs – in fact,
                                        one cannot draw a comparison, they are one in the same.</para>
                              <para>The documents attached in appendix C and D, were drafted for the LCB volunteers who have since become members of
                                        SLUG. The LCB facility is still used as the central support hub that it was intended to be - except it is now
                                        referred to as SLUG Head quarters. SLUG, being an independent organisation, will draft their own versions of
                                        the samples below.</para>
