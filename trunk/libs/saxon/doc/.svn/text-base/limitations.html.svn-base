Limitations</font></b></p>

<p>This page lists areas where Saxon 6.5.5 is known to be non-conformant with
W3C specifications.</p>

<p>Since Saxon 6.5.5 is now stable and generally reliable, there are no plans to remove these limitations.</p>

<h2>XSLT 1.0 conformance</h2>


<ol>
<li><p>The characters used in the <code>xsl:decimal-format</code> element and the
picture string of <code>format-number</code> must have Unicode code points
less than 65535. (This is arguably in conformance with the specification, since XSLT 1.0 refers to
the specification of the <code>DecimalFormat</code> class in JDK 1.1, which has the same
limitation.)</p></li>

<li><p>The picture string of
<code>format-number</code> behaves as implemented in the Java 
<code>DecimalFormat</code> class for the JDK version in use, whereas
the XSLT specification mandates that it should behave as specified in JDK 1.1.</p></li>

<li><p>When the <code>version</code> attribute is set to <code>1.1</code>, Saxon
recognizes certain constructs that were defined in the draft XSLT 1.1 specification;
XSLT 1.0 requires that such constructs are treated as errors.</p></li>

<li><p>An erratum to the XSLT 1.0 specification states that <code>xsl:copy</code> and <code>xsl:copy-of</code>
may be used to add a namespace node to a newly constructed element. This works correctly in Saxon, provided
that the name of the namespace node does not clash with the namespace prefix that Saxon has allocated to the
element for serialization purposes. (In principle, this namespace prefix should not be present in the result
tree, and should therefore be incapable of causing a conflict.) More details: see bug 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=637117&group_id=29872&atid=397617">637117</a>.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>XML 1.0 Conformance</h2>

<p>The default parser is a version of &AElig;lfred. There is one known non-conformance in
the version of the AElfred parser provided with the Saxon product: it does not enforce the
constraint that the contents of a general entity must be well-formed. Note, however, that this
parser does not perform XML validation.</p>
