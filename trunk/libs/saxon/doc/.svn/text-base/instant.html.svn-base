<p><b>Version 6.5.3 clears a number of bugs; you will find these listed on the project
page at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon</a></b></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="Scope">
<h2>What is Instant SAXON?</h2>
</a>

<p>Instant SAXON is a cut-down version of the full
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">SAXON</a>
package. It provides an XSLT processor that can be executed directly on Windows 95/98/NT/2000
 platforms. It includes the same executable code as full Saxon, but omits source code,
 API documentation, and sample applications.</p>
 
 <p><i>Microsoft no longer ship their Java VM with new releases of Windows. If the Microsoft Java VM is not
 installed on your system, you should use the full Saxon product, together with the latest
 Java VM from Sun.</i></p>
 
 <p><i>Note: the name "Instant" was originally chosen for two reasons: ease of download
 and installation, and execution speed. The advantage in execution speed arose because
 a packaged executable was much faster to load than a conventional Java archive. This
 is no longer true; in fact, Saxon runs up to three times faster using Sun's JDK 1.3
 Java VM than it does with the Microsoft Java VM. For high performance, the full Saxon
 product, run under JDK 1.3, is therefore recommended.</i></p>
 

<p>The XSLT processor is a complete implementation of the W3C 
XSLT 1.0 specification from the World Wide Web Consortium, found at
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116</a> (including the associated XPath syntax)
with a number of powerful extensions</p>

<hr>
<A name="Installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You need a machine running Windows (95, 98, NT, or 2000), with the Microsoft Java Virtual
Machine.</p>

<p>You will need an unzip utility such as WinZIP.</p>

<p>Because the product is run from the command line, you might find it useful to have a text editor
with better command-line support than the standard DOS window. I use <b>Programmer's File Editor (PFE)</b>,
a free product available from a number of download sites, 
<a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe/">listed here</a>.
Another suitable product (available as shareware) is
 <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">UltraEdit</a>.</p>

<p>No other software is required. Instant SAXON comes with a bundled XML parser, the AElfred parser
from <a href="http://www.microstar.com/">Microstar</a>. This version of Aelfred has been modified to support
the SAX2 interface and to fix known errors.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Download the file instant-saxonVVV.zip (400 Kb) to a convenient directory. You will find
an index of the available versions of this file on the 
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon home page</a>.</p>

<p>Unzip the file into the directory from which you intend to execute it, e.g. <b>c:\saxon</b></p>

<p>It contains two files: <b>saxon.exe</b>, which is the XSLT processor, and <b>instant.html</b>,
which is a copy of the HTML page you are reading.</p>

<hr>
<A name="Writing"><h2>Writing a stylesheet</h2></a>

<p>The syntax for stylesheets is exactly the same as for the full SAXON product. It is described
in the following pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.3/xsl-elements.html">XSL elements</a></li>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.3/expressions.html">XSL expressions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.3/patterns.html">XSL patterns</a></li>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.3/conformance.html">XSL conformance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.3/extensions.html">SAXON extensions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For more advanced functionality, such as writing your own extension functions, or
embedding Saxon within an application, please see the documentation that comes with
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">the full SAXON package</a>. </p>

<hr>
<A name="Running"><h2>Running a stylesheet</h2></a>

<p>The SAXON XSLT interpreter is designed to be run from the command line:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a DOS window</li>
<li>Change to the directory in which you installed saxon.exe
(e.g. <font color="#FF0080">cd c:\saxon</font>) or place this directory on your PATH</li>
<li>Run the command:

<p><strong><font color="#FF0080">saxon <i>
&nbsp;[options]&nbsp;&nbsp; source.xml&nbsp;&nbsp; style.xsl</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;  [ <i>params&#133;</i>]</font></strong></p>

<p>The options must come first, then the two file names, then the params.
The stylesheet is omitted if the -a option is present.</p>

<p>The options are:</p>

<table>

<tr><td valign="top" width="25%">-a</dt>
<td>Use the xml-stylesheet processing instruction in the source document
to identify the stylesheet to be used. The style-doc argument should be omitted.
Stylesheets embedded within the source document are not supported at this release.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-ds | -dt</td>
<td>Selects the implementation of the internal tree model. -dt selects the "tinytree"
model (the default). -ds selects the traditional tree model.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-l</td>
<td>Switches line numbering on for the source document. Line numbers are accessible
through the extension function saxon:line-number(), or from a trace listener.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-m classname</td>
<td>Use the specified Emitter to process the output from xsl:message. The class must implement
the com.icl.saxon.output.Emitter class. This interface is similar to a SAX ContentHandler,
it takes a stream of events to generate output. In general the content of a message is an XML
fragment. By default the standard XML emitter is used, configured to write to the standard error
stream, and to include no XML declaration. Each message is output as a new document.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-noext</td>
<td>Suppress calls on extension functions, other than system-supplied Saxon and EXSLT extension
functions. This option is useful when loading an untrusted stylesheet, perhaps from a remote
site using an <code>http://</code> URL; it ensures that the stylesheet cannot call Java methods
and thereby gain privileged access to resources on your machine.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-r classname</td>
<td>Use the specified URIResolver to process all URIs. The URIResolver is a user-defined class,
that extends the com.icl.saxon.URIResolver class, whose function is to take a URI supplied as
a string, and return a SAX InputSource. It is invoked to process URIs used in the document() function,
in the xsl:include and xsl:import elements, and (if -u is also specified) to process the URIs
of the source file and stylesheet file provided on the command line.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-o filename</td>
<td>Send output to named file. In the absence of this option, output goes to standard output.
The file extension of the output file is used to decide the default output method
if none is specified.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-t</td>
<td>Display version and timing information to the standard error output</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-T</td>
<td>Display stylesheet tracing information to the standard error output. Also
switches line numbering on for the source document.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-TL classname</td>
<td>Run the stylesheet using the specified TraceListener. The classname names a user-defined
class, which must implement com.icl.saxon.trace.TraceListener</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-u</td>
<td>Indicates that the names of the source document and the style document are URLs;
otherwise they are taken as filenames, unless they start with "http:" or "file:", in which
case they are taken as URLs</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-w0, w1, or w2</td>
<td>Indicates the policy for handling recoverable errors in the stylesheet: w0 means
recover silently, w1 means recover after writing a warning message to the system error
output, w2 means signal the error and do not attempt recovery. (Note, this does not
currently apply to all errors that the XSLT recommendation describes as recoverable).
The default is w1.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-x classname</td>
<td>Use the specified SAX parser for source file and for any files loaded using the document() function.
 The parser must be the fully-qualified class name
of a Java class that implements the org.xml.sax.Parser or org.xml.sax.XMLReader interface</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-y classname</td>
<td>Use the specified SAX parser for all stylesheet files, including any loaded using xsl:include
or xsl:import. The parser must be the fully-qualified class name
of a Java class that implements the org.xml.sax.Parser or org.xml.sax.XMLReader interface</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">-?</td><td>Display command syntax</td></tr>

</table>

<p>A param takes the form <i>name=value</i>, <i>name</i> being the
name of the parameter, and <i>value</i> the value of the parameter. These parameters are
accessible within the stylesheet as normal variables, using the $name syntax, provided
they are declared using a top-level xsl:param element. If there is no such declaration, the supplied
 parameter value is silently ignored.</p>

<p>You can specify a parameter value containing spaces by enclosing it in double quotes, for
example <b>name="John Brown"</b>
 
<p>If the -a option is used, the name of the stylesheet is
omitted. The &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction must have a pseudo-attribute href that
identifies the relative or absolute URL of the stylsheet document, and a pseudo-attribute type whose
value is "text/xml", "application/xml", or "text/xsl". For example:

<p><strong><font color="#FF0080">&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../style3.xsl" ?&gt;
</font></strong></p>

<p>Once registered, you can post messages to <a href="mailto:saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net">saxon-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you hit something that looks like a bug, please check the known errors on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon">the Saxon project pages at SourceForge</a>.
Also check the list archives.</p>

<p>If the query relates to the XSLT/XPath language rather than Saxon itself, it is better to use
 the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. Another useful site for XSLT information is
