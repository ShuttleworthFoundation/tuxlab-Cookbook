                              <para>Support for a &productname; lab is both formal and informal, but the starting place is the &productname;
                                        support desk.</para>
                              <para>The support desk serves a number of roles in the &productname; model. It is not just a technical support desk
                                        dealing with technical issues but is also an important contact point for the schools.</para>
                              <para>However its primary goal is to resolve technical issues experienced in a &productname; as soon as possible. In
                                        our experience, issues range from simple questions about how to use applications to quite technically
                                        challenging issues that may often need to be resolved on site.</para>

                                        <para>We use Request Tracker to log and track issues reported to the support desk. It is an Open Source

                                                  <para>Support requests are logged in RT as Tickets. The person who logs the ticket in RT is called
                                                            the Requestor, tickets can be created by clients (schools) or by the support desk staff.
                                                            Typically RT is set up so that clients can view their own tickets but not modify them in
                                                            any way.</para>
                                                  <para>We use the Queues in RT to classify tickets. It is possible to set up many different queues.
                                                            In our installation, we have queues for the different locations (Western Cape, Eastern
                                                            Cape and Limpopo), we have a queue for Escalated issues, and one for software bugs that

                                                  <para>Tickets are also classified by their Status. In a normal RT installation the following

                              <para>Currently the Shuttleworth Foundation tuXlabs comprises of 178 schools in 3 geographically distinct areas. The
                                        support desk mainly services the schools in the greater Cape Town area, which is a total of 120 schools. The
                                        support desk has 2 telephonic support technicians, one on site support technician and one manager.</para>
                              <para>Schools can make contact with the support desk in three ways:</para>

                              <para>The telephonic support agents are the first line of contact the schools have from the foundation. Typically they
                                        will log a issue with the help desk telephonically. A process (see later in this module) is followed where the
                                        telephonic agent logs and attempts to resolve the issue over the phone. If the issue can not be resolved
                                        within a set number of days – or the problem is identified as one that can not be resolved telephonically –
                                        the on site support agent takes ownership of the issue.</para>
                              <para>The on-site support technician is briefed by the support desk manager and the telephonic support agent who had
                                        ownership of the issue. This should include an explanation of the issue, what the support agent has asked the
                                        &productname; coordinator to do to resolve the issue and any historical issues in the specific lab which
                                        might have an impact on the on-site support agent's understanding of the issue and the proposed solution. A
                                        range of possible solutions are discussed and a strategy is formulated. </para>
                              <para>The successful resolution of the issue the first time the on-site support agent visits the school depends on how
                                        well she is prepared. Because we are dealing with schools we have a limited time in which to access the
                                        &productname; and the &productname; coordinator, so every effort needs to be made to correctly
                                        identify the problem before the on-site support agent visits the school. This is often not possible but there
                                        is nothing as frustrating as finding that though the solution is easy you are unable to resolve it because you
                                        are not adequately prepared.</para>

                                        <para>Your &productname; uses a star topology. This means that every thin client connects directly to the
                                                  switch, giving it a fast connection to the &productname; server. In other topologies, such as
                                                  ring topologies, messages are passed on from computer to computer. Star topologies are the fastest,
                                                  and are best suited for thin client computers.</para>
                                        <para>In the diagram below, you will notice that all the thin clients, as well as the server, connect to the
                                                  switch using CAT-5 cable. The server connects to a special high-speed port on the switch, called the
                                                  "Gigabit" port. It has ten times the data throughput of the other ports, allowing computers to have
                                                  fast access to the server. This is necessary because all the clients are constantly talking to the
                                                  server, and not to each other.</para>
                                        <para>If your lab has an internet or e-mail setup, your server will also be connected to a
                                                  <emphasis>gateway</emphasis> computer. This computer will dial up at night to collect your email and
                                                  off-line content. The gateway computer will have a modem attached, that converts the sounds from
                                                  your phone line to digital signals that your computer can understand, and vice-versa.</para>
                                        <para>With troubleshooting, more than half the work is actually identifying the problem. Once you have a good
                                                  overview of how things fit together, it is easier to locate the cause of the problem.</para>
                                        <para>Thin clients rely on a network connection to work, so if <emphasis>all</emphasis> the computers fail to
                                                  start up, you might want to check if the networking switch is turned on, or that the server is
                                                  properly connected to a switch. If only one computer fails to start, it might be a problem with the
                                                  cable connecting that computer to the switch. To make sure of this, plug this cable into a computer
                                                  that starts successfully. If it stops working while using this cable and resumes working normally
                                                  when the original cable is replaced, you know that the problem lies with the cable.</para>
                                        <para>To fix the cable, you can try crimping the cable ends again. Examine both the switch end and the
                                                  workstation end of the cable, making sure that all the copper wires in the CAT-5 cable are pushed up
                                                  right to the end of the cable. If you notice something wrong, cut the cable a couple of centimetres
                                                  beyond the RJ-45 jack, and connect a new RJ-45 jack with the crimping tool</para>
