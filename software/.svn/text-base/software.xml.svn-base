                              <para>As mentioned in the Introductory book to the &productname; Cookbook, the &productname; project uses Open
                                        Source software wherever possible. The exceptions are only where no suitable Open Source alternative could be
                                        found. Currently, the only proprietary software content used in &productname;s is that which is added on
                                        in specific projects, allowing for localised content or specific school management software. All the software
                                        that is part of the &productname; falls under Open Source licenses, and the software itself will always be
                                        100% free.</para>
                              <para>We have also already seen that Open Source software is used in the &productname; project because it overcomes
                                        some of the barriers caused by proprietary (also often referred to as “closed source”) software. These
                                        barriers included:</para>

                              <para>The &productname; project would simply not be possible without the use of Open Source software. We believe
                                        that Open Source software will continue to mature at an ever increasing rate, and that more and more people
                                        will find using this liberating form of technology more pleasant than the traditional, proprietary licensed
                                        counterparts.</para>

                                        <para>A Wizzy server can be used to provide a managed internet access solution for a &productname;, also
                                                  known as a <emphasis>gateway</emphasis> server. Currently, a Wizzy server is an extra to a
                                                  &productname; install. The Shuttleworth Foundation may award a Wizzy server computer to a school
                                                  with a &productname; if the school demonstrates that it is making good use of the lab. Wizzy is
                                                  a project of Andy Rabagliati, a techno-philanthropist who has been wiring rural schools for cheap
                                                  internet connectivity for many years now.</para>
                                        <para>The software is based on RedHat Linux, currently version 8.0, whereas K12LTSP is based on RedHat Fedora.
                                                  Wizzy uses an adapted version of <ulink url="http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/"> Whitebox Linux</ulink>,

                                        <para>It performs the duties of dialup manager, firewall, mailserver , web cache, and authentication server.
                                                  The Wizzy server does normal dialup via a telephone line, but it can also do <acronym>ADSL</acronym>
                                                  and wireless connections. It would be possible to do all these things on the classroom
                                                  <acronym>LTSP</acronym> server as well, but a custom mail arrangement would still be necessary:
                                                  while the &productname; is not connected to the internet, mail needs to be delivered to a remote
                                                  server. Another reason to separate the internet gateway from the classroom server is that it is not
                                                  a good idea for a classroom server to have a public-facing IP address. All machines exposed to the
                                                  internet are vulnerable to hackers and new virus codes, and the classroom server contains all the
                                                  user data that could be lost if it were compromised.</para>
                                        <para>The way in which the Wizzy server sends and receives email is customised to work with an intermittent
                                                  internet connection. It utilises a protocol that was more commonly used in the days before permanent
                                                  internet connections became common, namely UUCP (the Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol). UUCP is suited to
                                                  queueing data to be copied to remote hosts for delivery when a network connection is established.</para>
                                        <para>Wizzy has the goal of providing all its services via UUCP in order to accommodate high latency
                                                  connections where there may be long disconnected periods. This type of connection includes
                                                  situations where a connection is established by dialling up at night when phone rates are low, as
                                                  well as situations without any dialup access at all.</para>
                                        <para>In cases without dialup access, the connection can be made by carrying the data across by hand! <footnote>

                                                  laptop, or a USB hard drive. The transfer medium will contain newly fetched data and the queued
                                                  requests for new web pages, as well as mail waiting to be sent. This is not a stated goal of the
                                                  &productname;s project, so if your school wishes to pursue this route, you may have to contact
                                                  Wizzy to work out the details.</para>

                                                  night when the rates are low (Telkom South Africa provides a particular phone account that allows a
                                                  single 12 hour phone call for R7). In this period, approximately 250MB of email and web material can
                                                  be downloaded onto the Wizzy server in the classroom. In the morning, after the phone has been hung
                                                  up, the learners can access the downloaded material as though they had a direct web connection.
                                                  Their experience of email and web during the school day is almost identical to a very fast online
                                                  web experience, with the exception that newly requested pages will only be available by the next morning.<footnote>

                                        <para>Normally, if you want to connect to the internet, you need a telephone line and a modem, a satellite
                                                  uplink, or some other means of tapping into 'the Net'. Unfortunately, in South Africa, the necessary
                                                  telecommunications infrastructure is not always there to tap into. Around a third of South Africans
                                                  don't have a phone line, and most schools do not have internet access (e.g roughly 88% of schools in
                                                  the Northern Province lack an internet connection). <footnote>

                                                  <para>While the delay in retrieving web pages is a necessary consequence of the Wizzy solution, it
                                                            has a desirable side effect in that it helps educators to manage web access. Since anybody
                                                            with an internet connection can publish on the Web, there is an absolute ocean of complete

                                                            school resources. Automated solutions to this issue have been proposed, often by companies
                                                            that market filtering products. Apart from the fact that these products suffer from both
                                                            false positives and negatives, blocking material unnecessarily and letting undesirable

                                                  <para>The Wizzy solution believes that it's better to let the teacher decide what is appropriate.
                                                            This also allows the teacher to stay in touch with the material accessed by the learners
                                                            he or she is teaching. Teachers can explicitly choose the web material that learners can
                                                            access and definitively reject web material that is not appropriate. They can also set the
                                                            Wizzy server to monitor websites, retrieving new versions as they become available.</para>
                                                  <para>Because the school is never in direct connection with the internet, but rather has its web
                                                            content delivered upon request, students cannot "surf" the internet. However, since all

                                                  <para>These specially chosen web sites can easily number in the hundreds. They can be updated daily;
                                                            and should a new site be desired on a regular basis, the school would have to wait only
                                                            one day for the delivery to begin. The "surfing" of this miniature internet within the

                                                  Depending on which education aware distribution of Linux you have chosen (we profiled four in the

                                                  What we present here is a basic installation sequence that can be used as an example or comparison
                                                  with the installation of the Linux distribution of your choice.</para>

                                                  computer. You will be presented with a welcome screen. If you do require more help on starting up
                                                  there is usually an on screen command that will bring you more options (e.g. pressing F2). We
