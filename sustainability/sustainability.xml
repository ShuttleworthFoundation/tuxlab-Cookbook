                              <para>In January 2005, the United Nations declared a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development . This coincides
                                        with the goals of the &productname; project and the goals of this cookbook. A good definition of
                                        development sustainability is<quote>the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has
                                                  been completed</quote> (Australian Agency for International Development 2000). Ensuring that
                                        development projects are sustainable can reduce the likelihood of their collapse after the initial pilot
                                        projects. It also reduces the financial cost of development projects and the subsequent social problems, such
                                        as dependence of the stakeholders on external donors and their resources. All development assistance, apart
                                        from temporary emergency and humanitarian relief efforts, should be designed and implemented with the aim of
                                        achieving sustainable benefits. There are ten key factors that influence development sustainability:</para>

                              <para>This information was first published in Tectonic, May 15 2006 by Jason Norwood-Young.</para>
                              <para>St Martin's High School in Orlando West, Soweto, has a 30-PC &productname; computer lab. Running Edubuntu – an
                                        education-specific port of Ubuntu – the lab sports brand new equipment from Acer. Unlike some other computer
                                        laboratories, that face a loosing battle against support needs and unskilled teachers, St Martin's laboratory
                                        will be run by Sowetan entrepreneur Clifford Nkosi.</para>
                              <para>"What the pilot will try to address within schools is the constant problem of sustainability and promoting use of
                                        labs, maintenance, and general issues around computer problems. Schools themselves don't have the time or
                                        resources to take advantage of the fact that there's a community around them that also requires these
                                        services, so they can't use the computers and internet access to generate funds. By using an entrepreneurial
                                        partner, one can address issue of sustainability and funds, that can be used as funds for school, to maintain
                                        the lab, and pay someone's salary," says Hilton Theunissen, open source project lead, The Shuttleworth
                                        Foundation.</para>
                              <para>To stimulate interest amongst students, Nkosi has started a &quot;geek club&quot; amongst learners. The
                                        geek club will be exposed to open source in the workplace, with trips to open source companies, and will also
                                        be able to get computer certifications like the OpenICDL and LPI certifications.</para>
                              <para>As a marketing drive to the general community, Nkosi has offered 20 unemployed members of the community an
                                        introductory course to computers for free. Lab training and services will also be available to the general
                                        community from 2:00pm to 5:00pm for a fee.</para>
                              <para>Nkosi says that his main concern at this point is cash flow, and he is currently looking for funding, particularly
                                        to pay an assistant for both training and support. The ex-Acer employee says that he's always had a nack for
                                        entrepreneurship, having started his first small business selling clothing in high school.</para>
                              <para>"His main aim is to make money in a socially conscience way," says Theunissen. "He's pushing the boundaries on
                                        this one."</para>
                              <para>If the project is successful, Theunissen hopes that the model can be adopted both nationally and internationally.
                                        Acer is particularly interested in the results, he says, and could consider this as a model for other
                                        sustainable development projects.</para>
