                              <para>It is not hard to imagine looking into a computer lab and seeing the computers. In a &productname; there are
                                        two subsections of hardware, thin-client workstations and the &productname; server. Before we discuss the
                                        setup and configuration of the server and the workstations let's take some time to discuss the theory behind
                                        each of these hardware subsections.</para>

                                                            thin client asks a central server to do most of its processing, and keeps as little
                                                            hardware and software as possible on the workstation side. Ideally, the user of a thin
                                                            client should have only a screen, keyboard, mouse and enough computing power to handle
                                                            display and network communications --- you don't even need (or want) a hard drive. The

                                                  <para>A fat client does as much processing as possible by itself, and only passes data required for

                                                  <para>A thin client may be a software program executing on a generic PC, or it may be a hardware
                                                            device, called a terminal, designed to provide only user input and display functions.
                                                            Because old PCs (whether retired, written off, obsolete or just out of fashion) are easier
                                                            to find than specialised thin client hardware, &productname;s uses them as thin
                                                            clients, with the appropriate software. Because they don't do much work themselves, the
                                                            hardware requirements for these "old" PCs are very basic. Since every client in a thin
                                                            client network asks a central server to do its work, all the individual workstations look
                                                            the same: they all share the same server, and they all behave exactly like the server
                                                            would if you were using it directly.</para>
                                                  <para>In addition, although everyone who uses the lab can have their own computing environment
                                                            stored on the server, with their own files, desktop, and so on, the individual
                                                            workstations can't get viruses or be misconfigured by curious learners - there simply
                                                            isn't anything to configure! The thin client doesn't have enough brains to get confused.</para>
                                                  <para>This means that the lab computers are trivial to keep up and maintenance is restricted to the
                                                            server in the back room.</para>
                                                  <para>Thin clients are cheaper and require less administration than fat clients. On the other hand,
                                                            they tend to require far greater network bandwidth, as display data will probably need to
                                                            be passed to the thin clients. They can't do a single thing on their own - for each and
                                                            every action, they need to talk to the server. This means that a server for a room full of
                                                            thin clients must be much more capable than a server used by fat clients.</para>
                                                  <para>One of the advantages that this configuration entails is that all the software resides on the
                                                            server, and so you only have to upgrade it once. In a fat client configuration, every
                                                            workstation has its own copies of the software, and so any upgrade needs to be rolled out
                                                            to every workstation.</para>

                                        <para>The first thing to do is to set up a static free environment in which to work on the computers. This can
                                                  be as simple as setting up a static free surface on a desk or wearing an antistatic wrist band
                                                  connected to the computer you are working on. If neither of these two options are available to you,
                                                  then work on a clean metal desktop and regularly discharge any static electricity build up by
                                                  touching the surface of the desk with your fingers before touching any computer component.</para>
                                        <para>Now you need to unscrew the case of the computer and clean out any dust build up by spraying compressed
                                                  air over the motherboard and components. Remember to aim the air spray in such a manner that the
                                                  dust is blown out of the case, away from your face. Once the accumulation of dust has been cleaned,
                                                  you need to asses what components are in the computer. Identify the graphics adapter, the amount of
                                                  memory, whether the computer has a network adapter, a sound card, a modem, or any other peripheral
                                                  card within it.</para>
                                        <para>Remove all of the hardware that a thin client will not be using (i.e. harddrives, modems, etc.). If you
                                                  are removing a harddrive, either return it to the donor or format the harddrive before removing it
                                                  so that the data originally contained on the disk is erased. Now either write serial numbers on the
                                                  computer components or make stickers with serial numbers and stick them on the motherboard, cards,
                                                  and computer case. Make a record of all the serial numbers in a book or in the school's inventory
                                                  management system.</para>
                                        <para>The final step is to put the computer case back on and attach the cables. Switch it on to check that the
                                                  remaining hardware is fully functioning (as there is no harddrive you will not be able to boot until
                                                  you have configured the workstation to be LTSP bootable, what we'll discuss next...).</para>

                                                  <title>Making a workstation LTSP bootable</title>
                                                  <para>There are several methods that one can use to make a computer boot to an LTSP network. This
                                                            includes booting from an existing storage medium, such as CD-ROM, floppy or hard disk
                                                            using an Etherboot image. This however, is not the recommended method, since CD-ROM discs
                                                            and floppy disks can be removed from the computer, and old hard disks tend to have a high
                                                            failure rate. Most new computers are sold with on-board network cards, which typically
                                                            have PXE (Pre-Execution Environment) installed, which will work fine with LTSP. Although
                                                            older versions of PXE may work fine, it is recommended that you purchase a card with PXE
                                                            version 2.0 or later.</para>
                                                  <para>If you are using an older computer, which is not PXE capable, you might want to consider
                                                            buying a network card with PXE enabled (contact your local hardware vendor), or, you could
                                                            purchase a network card with an Etherboot ROM chip installed, which you can still purchase
                                                            from <ulink url="http://www.netday.org.za">netday.org.za</ulink>.</para>

                                                  using a network, worlds of possibility open up. In a network, better use is made of all the

                                                  printer, everyone can use it. It is also possible to concentrate resources where they will have the
                                                  greatest benefit --- all the additional memory added to the server becomes available for running the

                                                            would need their own copy of such files. This is the case for the whole operating system

                                        <para>In this section, we have a look at the different kinds of equipment that we need to set up a network.</para>
                                        <para>There are many different kinds of computer networks, with different strengths and weaknesses. Some might
                                                  be designed for the maximum data transfer speed, some to minimise costs, and others to make it as
                                                  easy as possible to connect computers to one another. In the case of &productname;s, we need a
                                                  really fast network, because everything displayed by the client workstations needs to be sent from
                                                  the server over the network. We also need a standard network that allows any kind of computer or
                                                  peripheral to be added to the network easily.</para>
                                        <para>In order to meet these criteria, &productname; uses an <emphasis>Ethernet</emphasis> network with
                                                            <emphasis>category 5</emphasis> network cabling (CAT-5, for short).</para>
                                        <para>In an Ethernet, data packets are broadcast onto the network for all connected devices to receive. The
                                                  devices themselves then examine the data packet to determine whether it was meant for them. If so,
                                                  they process it; otherwise, they drop it on the floor and it vanishes.</para>
                                        <para>The name "Ethernet" comes from the ancient Greek concept of "ether". According to them, this was the
                                                  fluid that filled the spaces between stars. Of course there isn't any such thing, but they made it
                                                  up because surely there couldn't be <emphasis>nothing</emphasis> between stars, could there? In an
                                                  Ethernet, as far as the communicating computers are concerned, there aren't any cables either. Of
                                                  course there really are cables, but you don't have to send a data packet down a specific cable to a
                                                  specific computer. You just entrust it to the "ether", and all computers get the packet.</para>

                                                  <para>There are different ways of wiring an Ethernet local area network. One way is to simply lay
                                                            coaxial cable from one computer to the next, until all the computers are connected,
                                                            forming a <emphasis>ring</emphasis>. This is relatively simple, but the resulting network
                                                            is slow, both because of the electrical properties of the coaxial cable, and because all
                                                            the data has to share a single cable.</para>
                                                  <para>Since a &productname; needs more speed, a <emphasis>star</emphasis> topology is used
                                                            instead. In this configuration, a single CAT-5 cable connects each workstation to a
                                                            central node. This central node acts as an interchange. In a simple network where speed
                                                            isn't critical, this node can be a <emphasis>hub</emphasis>. This is a device with ports
                                                            where you can plug in many network cables; usually 8, 16 or 24. A hub is very chatty: it
                                                            simply repeats all the data coming in on one port on all the other ports. This way, the
                                                            data is sure to reach the computer it's meant for. Unfortunately, it also reaches all the

                                                  <para>Category 5 cable, commonly known as CAT-5, is an unshielded twisted pair type cable designed
                                                            for high signal integrity. The actual standard defines specific electrical properties of
                                                            the wire, but it is most commonly known as being rated for its Ethernet capability of 100
                                                            MBit/s. Its specific standard designation is EIA/TIA-568. CAT-5 cable typically has three
                                                            twists per inch of each twisted pair of 24 gauge copper wires within the cable. Another
                                                            important characteristic is that the wires are insulated with a plastic (FEP) that has low
                                                            dispersion; that is, the dielectric constant of the plastic does not depend greatly on
                                                            frequency. Special attention also has to be paid to minimising impedance mismatches at
                                                            connection points. In practise, this means that, when you attach connectors to the cable
                                                            ends, you shouldn't untwist more of the cable than absolutely necessary.</para>

                                                  receive email or access the internet, it is necessary to connect to further networks. This happens
                                                  over a <emphasis>wide area network</emphasis>, or WAN. A WAN is a computer network covering a wide
                                                  geographical area. The grandest example of a WAN is the internet.</para>
                                        <para>WANs are used to connect local area networks together, so that users and computers in one location can
                                                  communicate with users and computers in other locations. Many WANs are built for one particular
                                                  organisation and are private; others, built by internet service providers, provide connections from

                                                  leased lines. At each end of the leased line, a router connects to the <acronym>LAN</acronym> on one

                                        <para>While a <acronym>LAN</acronym> is a network of computers and devices, a WAN is most often a network of
                                                  networks. A router, or a computer configured to function as a router, on each network, connects to

                                                  internet. It is then the function of the internet gateway computer to route packets from outside
                                                  networks to the correct computer on the inside. All the computers on a <acronym>LAN</acronym> share
                                                  a single connection to the internet. In the case of &productname;s, the Wizzy server, if you
                                                  have one, acts as a gateway computer.</para>
                                        <para>However, because a permanent WAN connection is very expensive in South Africa, especially in rural areas

                                        <para>The network protocol of the &productname; <acronym>LAN</acronym> is the same as that used for
                                                  communication on the internet, namely <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym>. This is the <emphasis>Transmission
                                                            Control Protocol (TCP)</emphasis>, encapsulated within the <emphasis>Internet Protocol
                                                            (IP)</emphasis>. The Internet Protocol takes care of routing data packets from a source IP
                                                  address to a destination IP address. An IP address consists of four numbers that look like this:
                                                            <literal>192.168.10.200</literal>. IP packets can contain TCP packets. Whereas an IP
                                                  packet only knows where it should go, TCP packets contain information about their position in a
                                                  sequence of packets.</para>
                                        <para>TCP is wonderful: it makes it possible to treat a flaky network as though it were perfectly reliable.
                                                  When you send anything across a <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> network (e.g. an email message, an image,
                                                  or a document) it is broken down into many TCP packets. These are numbered and sent, one by one, to
                                                  the destination computer. At the destination, the sequence number is used to put the packets in the
                                                  correct order (as they may have become mixed up in transit). If there are gaps in the sequence, only
                                                  those packets are requested again. If some packets are received more than once, the extra packets
                                                  are simply dropped. Once all the packets in the sequence have been received, the entire file has
                                                  been transferred successfully.</para>
                                        <para>Unsurprisingly, an IP address cannot be just any four numbers. Actually, there is a lot of underlying
                                                  structure. In the first place, the numbers are a sequence of four <emphasis>bytes</emphasis>.
                                                  Computers generally handle data one byte at a time, so it's convenient to specify things as a
                                                  sequence of bytes. A byte consists of eight binary digits. The binary number system has only two
                                                  digits, namely 0 and 1: just as 99999999 is the largest number that you can express with eight
                                                  decimal digits, 11111111 is the largest number that you can express with eight binary digits. If you
                                                  convert that number to decimal, you get 256. For this reason, a sequence like
                                                  <literal>300.5.502.743</literal> does not make any sense as an IP address.</para>
                                        <para>In the second place, some address ranges are reserved. For example, all the networks that start with
                                                            <literal>192.168.***.***</literal> as their first two digits are private, not routed on
                                                  the internet. The whole public IP address space is divided among ISPs. Each <acronym>ISP</acronym>
                                                  gets a range of numbers that they may portion out between its customers. This range of numbers is
                                                  described in terms of a <emphasis>netmask</emphasis>, a number which looks similar to an IP address,
                                                  but is used to match all the IP addresses that belong to a particular network. Private networks can
                                                  also be segmented into subnets using netmasks. Any computer on a network can send IP packets to any
                                                  other computer on the network, but to send an IP packet to a computer on a

                                                  the packets cross from one network to another.</para>
                                        <para>Gateway computers also implement network management policies, e.g. by way of firewall software, that
                                                  specify what traffic is allowed into and out of a network.</para>

                                        <para>A Wizzy server plays two roles. In the first place, it serves as an internet proxy, serving cached pages
                                                  to a lab without a permanent internet connection. In the second place, it connects to the internet
                                                  and retrieves requested pages to store them locally, sends queued email, and fetches received mail.</para>
                                        <para>These two roles don't have to be fulfilled by the same server: they may be split across two servers, for
                                                  example if the school has no internet access. In this case, there will be a Wizzy in the
                                                  &productname; and another one at a remote location with internet connectivity.</para>
                                        <para>The hardware requirements for the Wizzy server are far less than those of the classroom application
                                                  server, since it has to do far less work. All it needs to do most of the time is to serve up saved
                                                  pages from its hard disk. For this, a server with a 200+MHz <acronym>CPU</acronym>, 256MB

                                        <para>Every computer on a local area network ( <acronym>LAN</acronym>) needs to have a unique IP address so
                                                  that it may send and receive data. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (
                                                  <acronym>DHCP</acronym>) is a networking protocol that allocates IP addresses dynamically to
                                                  computers on a <acronym>LAN</acronym>. Without it, an administrator needs to give each client
                                                  computer a static IP address manually. This may seem simple enough to begin with, but given time, it
                                                  slowly turns into a nightmare: computers are added, removed or moved about, and the number
                                                  assignments eventually become arbitrary and troublesome to keep track of. On a network with manually
                                                  assigned addresses, it's also awkward to connect transient devices such as laptop computers that are
                                                  also used on many other networks. You have to talk to the system administrator to find out the
                                                  network configuration, and then check the network to find a free address. With
                                                  <acronym>DHCP</acronym>, it's easy: just plug in an Ethernet cable for the new device, and it will
                                                  immediately request an IP address from the classroom server, which will assign an unused number to

                                        <para>In a &productname;, the classroom server is configured as a <acronym>DHCP</acronym> server. A system
                                                  administrator assigns a range of IP addresses to the server. Each client computer on the

                                                  up. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period. This eases
                                                  the network installation procedure on the client computer side considerably.</para>
                                        <para>In addition to the IP address, a <acronym>DHCP</acronym> server can set other configuration information,
                                                  such as the address of the <acronym>DNS</acronym> server, the <acronym>DNS</acronym> domain of the

                                        <para>Before I continue, let me explain the concepts I've just introduced. First, the <acronym>DNS</acronym>
                                                  domain: all Linux computers are given a hostname upon installation of the <acronym>OS</acronym>,
                                                  which is used in system messages and configuration. When the computer joins a network, its hostname
                                                  and the domain of the network together combine to form the Fully Qualified Domain Name (

                                                  <acronym>FQDN</acronym> of each workstation will be something like

                                                  to reach a server on another network, there needs to be a gateway that is connected to both networks
                                                  at once. Usually, the gateway computer will have a network card for every network to which it is
                                                  connected.</para>
                                        <para>By default, the <acronym>LTSP</acronym> server uses its first network card ( <literal>eth0</literal>,
